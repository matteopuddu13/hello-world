As a Certified Financial Educator, high school Economics teacher, and FinTech analyst, I specialize in **helping individuals understand** how to optimize their investments and increase their financial literacy. 

My research interests include programming for finance, data analytics and innovation in financial education. 

In my spare time, I talk about fintech on [Consizos.com](www.consizos.com), speak at conferences and contribute to free financial education. 

I'm passionate about :snake: Python programming, as well as new ways of educating and **empowering** people. I think anyone can learn to improve its financial health all it takes is get back into the game.
